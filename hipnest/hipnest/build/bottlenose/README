Bottlenose
==========

Description
-----------

Bottlenose is a thin Python wrapper over the Amazon Product Advertising API. There is practically no overhead. Before you get started, make sure you have both Amazon Product Advertising and AWS accounts (yes, they are separate--confusing, I know).

Features
--------

* Compatible with Python versions 2.4 and up
* Support for CA, CN, DE, ES, FR, IT, JP, UK, and US Amazon endpoints
* No requirements, except simplejson for Python pre-2.6

Usage
-----

     >>> import bottlenose
     >>> amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AMAZON_SECRET_KEY, AMAZON_ASSOC_TAG)
     >>> response = amazon.ItemLookup(ItemId="0596520999", ResponseGroup="Images",
         SearchIndex="Books", IdType="ISBN")
     <?xml version="1.0" ?><ItemLookupResponse xmlns="http://webservices.amazon...

Here's another example.

     >>> response = amazon.ItemSearch(Keywords="Kindle 3G", SearchIndex="All")
     <?xml version="1.0" ?><ItemSearchResponse xmlns="http://webservices.amazon...

Any valid API call from the following is supported (in addition to any others
that may be added in the future). Just plug in appropriate request parameters
for the operation you'd like to call, and you're good to go.
